# BigQuery overview

BigQuery is a fully managed, AI-ready data platform that helps
you manage and analyze your data with built-in features like machine learning,
search, geospatial analysis, and business intelligence.
BigQuery's serverless architecture lets you use languages like
SQL and Python to answer your organization's biggest questions with zero
infrastructure management.

BigQuery provides a uniform way to work with both structured and
unstructured data and supports open table formats like Apache Iceberg,
Delta, and Apache Hudi. BigQuery
streaming supports continuous data ingestion and analysis while
BigQuery's scalable, distributed analysis engine lets you query
terabytes in seconds and petabytes in minutes.

BigQuery offers built-in governance capabilities that let you discover and
curate data, and manage metadata and data quality. Through features like
semantic search and data lineage, you can find and validate relevant data for
analysis. You can share data and AI assets across your organization with the
benefits of access control. These features are powered by
Knowledge Catalog, which is a unified, intelligent governance solution for data
and AI assets in Google Cloud.

BigQuery's architecture consists of two parts: a storage layer that
ingests, stores, and optimizes data and a compute layer that provides analytics
capabilities. These compute and storage layers efficiently operate
independently of each other thanks to Google's petabit-scale network that
enables the necessary communication between them.

Legacy databases usually have to share resources between read and write
operations and analytical operations. This can result in resource conflicts and
can slow queries while data is written to or read from storage.
Shared resource pools can become further strained when resources are
required for database management tasks such as assigning or revoking
permissions. BigQuery's separation of compute and storage layers
lets each layer dynamically allocate resources without impacting the performance
or availability of the other.

![BigQuery architecture separates resources with petabit network.](/static/bigquery/images/bq-architecture.png)

This separation principle lets BigQuery innovate faster because
storage and compute improvements can be deployed independently, without downtime
or negative impact on system performance. It is also essential to offering a
fully managed serverless data warehouse in which the BigQuery
engineering team handles updates and maintenance. The result is that you don't
need to provision or manually scale resources, leaving you free to focus on
delivering value instead of traditional database management tasks.

BigQuery interfaces include Google Cloud console
interface and the BigQuery command-line tool. Developers and
data scientists can use client libraries with familiar programming including
Python, Java, JavaScript, and Go, as well as BigQuery's
REST API and RPC API to transform and manage data. ODBC
and JDBC drivers provide interaction with existing applications including
third-party tools and utilities.

As a data analyst, data engineer, data warehouse administrator, or data
scientist, BigQuery helps you load, process, and analyze data to inform
critical business decisions.

## Explore BigQuery

BigQuery's serverless infrastructure lets you focus on your data
instead of resource management. BigQuery combines a cloud-based
data warehouse and powerful analytic tools.

### BigQuery storage

BigQuery stores data using a columnar storage format that is
optimized for analytical queries. BigQuery presents data in
tables, rows, and columns and provides full support for database transaction
semantics ([ACID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID). BigQuery
storage is automatically replicated across multiple locations to provide high
availability.

- [Learn about common patterns to organize BigQuery resources](/bigquery/docs/resource-hierarchy#patterns) in the data warehouse and data marts.

BigQuery's top-level container of tables and views.
- [BigQuery Data Transfer Service](/bigquery/docs/dts-introduction) automates data ingestion.
- [Load data into BigQuery](/bigquery/docs/loading-data) using:
  * [Stream data](/bigquery/docs/streaming-data-into-bigquery) with the
[Storage Write API (gRPC)](/bigquery/docs/write-api).
  * [Batch load data](/bigquery/docs/batch-loading-data) from local files or

For more information, see [Overview of BigQuery storage](/bigquery/docs/storage_overview).

### BigQuery analytics

Descriptive and prescriptive analysis uses include business intelligence, ad hoc
analysis, geospatial analytics, and machine learning.

You can query data stored in BigQuery or run queries on data
where it lives using external tables or federated queries including
Cloud Storage, Bigtable, Spanner, or
Google Sheets stored in Google Drive.

- ANSI-standard SQL queries ([ISO/IEC 9075 support](https://www.iso.org/standard/76583.html))
including support for joins, nested and repeated fields, analytic and
aggregation functions, multi-statement queries, and a variety of
spatial functions with
geospatial analytics - Geographic Information Systems.

For more information, see [Overview of BigQuery analytics](/bigquery/docs/query-overview).

### BigQuery administration

BigQuery provides centralized management of data and compute
resources while [Identity and Access Management (IAM)](/iam/docs) helps you secure those resources with
the access model that's used throughout Google Cloud. [Google Cloud security best practices](https://cloud.google.com/security/best-practices) provide a solid yet flexible approach that can include perimeter security or
